## **Features**   
* Minimizes multiplication and division operations.
* Utilizes a 2-loop algorithm design.
* Comparative analysis showcasing improved computational efficiency.
## **Usage**  
1. Import the custom_sort function from the custom_sort.py module.
2. Provide the unsorted data as input to the custom_sort function.
3. Retrieve the sorted data as the output.
